## 📦 Microservices

### 👤 User Service

- User registration and login
- JWT token generation
- Secure authentication
- MongoDB persistence

### 📦 Order Service

- Create and fetch orders
- Communicates with Inventory Service
- MongoDB order storage

### 📊 Inventory Service

- Product and stock management
- Stock validation on order placement
- MongoDB inventory storage

### 🌐 API Gateway

- Single entry point for all requests
- JWT validation
- Routes requests to backend services

## 🐳 Docker (Local Development)

> `docker-compose` is used **only for local development**.  
> Render deploys each microservice independently.

```bash
docker-compose up --build

#Environment Variables
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/db
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-key

```
